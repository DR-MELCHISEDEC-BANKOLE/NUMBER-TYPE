# NUMBER-TYPE for BEGINNERS
**Imagine a digital toolbox with different compartments for storing numbers. Each compartment is a specific number type, designed to hold different kinds of numbers:**

### JavaScript
**JavaScript handles numbers differently compared to many other programming languages.**

**Key points to remember:**

- **Single Number Type:** JavaScript has only one number type, `Number`, which is a 64-bit double-precision floating-point type. This means it can represent both whole numbers and numbers with decimals.
- **Internal Representation:** Even when you write a number without a decimal point, like `10`, JavaScript still stores it internally as a floating-point value.
- **Implications:**
    - **Precision Limitations:** Floating-point numbers have inherent precision limitations, which can lead to rounding errors in certain calculations, especially with very large or very small numbers.
    - **Lossless Integer Operations:** Despite internal floating-point representation, JavaScript can still perform basic integer operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication) without losing precision for values within a safe integer range.
    - **BigInt for Large Integers:** For extremely large integers that exceed the safe integer range, JavaScript introduced the `BigInt` type (ES2020), which can handle arbitrary-precision integers.

**Example:**

```javascript
let num1 = 10;  // Stored as a floating-point value
let num2 = 3.14;
let num3 = 12345678901234567890;  // Might encounter precision issues
let bigNum = 9007199254740991n;  // Using BigInt for a large integer
```

### `BigInt` In Javascript
In JavaScript, while numbers are typically represented as 64-bit floating-point values, there is a distinct type called `BigInt`. `BigInt` is used to represent integers of arbitrary length, allowing you to work with numbers beyond the limitations of regular JavaScript numbers (which have a maximum safe integer size).

`BigInt` allows you to perform operations on very large integers without losing precision. It's denoted by appending `n` to the end of a number or by using the `BigInt()` constructor function.

For example:
```javascript
const regularNumber = 123456789012345678901234567890; // Regular number (may lose precision)
const bigIntNumber = 123456789012345678901234567890n; // BigInt

console.log(regularNumber); // Outputs: 123456789012345680000000000000
console.log(bigIntNumber); // Outputs: 123456789012345678901234567890
```

`BigInt` is distinct from regular JavaScript numbers and allows for precise operations on extremely large integers, providing flexibility beyond the limitations of standard 64-bit floating-point numbers.


**In contrast, languages like Python, Java, C++, and C# have distinct integer types (e.g., `int`, `long`) and floating-point types (e.g., `float`, `double`) for more control over number representation and precision.**

**Here's a table indicating number types associated with different programming languages, starting with JavaScript:**

| Language | Integer Types | Floating-Point Types | Other Number Types |
|---|---|---|---|
| JavaScript | Number (64-bit double-precision float, can represent whole numbers as well) | Number | BigInt (for arbitrarily large integers), boolean |
| Python | int, long (arbitrary precision), bool | float, double | complex, decimal.Decimal |
| Java | byte, short, int, long | float, double | boolean, char |
| C/C++ | char, short, int, long, long long | float, double | _Bool |
| C# | sbyte, byte, short, ushort, int, uint, long, ulong | float, double, decimal | bool |
| Swift | Int (8, 16, 32, 64), UInt (8, 16, 32, 64), Bool | Float, Double | Character, String.Index |
| Ruby | Fixnum (small integers), Bignum (large integers), bool | Float | Complex |
| PHP | int, float, bool |  | string (can be used for numeric calculations) |

**Key Points:**

- **JavaScript's Number type:** Uniquely handles both integers and floating-point numbers, with limitations for very large or precise integers.
- **Python's long type:** Offers arbitrary precision for integers.
- **Java's char type:** Stores single characters, but often treated as numeric values (Unicode code points).
- **C#'s decimal type:** Provides high-precision decimal representation.
- **Swift's Int and UInt types:** Configurable for different integer sizes.
- **Ruby's Fixnum and Bignum types:** Automatically handle different integer ranges.
- **PHP's string type:** Can be used for numeric calculations, but with potential type conversion issues.

**Remember:** Exact names, sizes, and behaviors of number types can vary slightly across languages. Consult language-specific documentation for precise details.

Here's an expanded table with more comprehensive details on number types:

| Number Type | Description | Examples | Typical Size (bits) | Precision | Common Subtypes | Range |
|-------------|-------------|----------|---------------------|-----------|-----------------|-------|
| Integer     | Whole numbers without decimals | -10, 0, 100 | 8, 16, 32, 64, 128 | Exact | int, short, long, byte | -(2^(n-1)) to 2^(n-1) - 1 (where n is the number of bits) |
| Floating-Point | Numbers with decimals, limited precision | 3.14159, 1.23e-5 | 32 (single precision), 64 (double precision), 128 (extended precision) | Approximate | float, double, long double | Varies based on the precision |
| Fixed-Point  | Numbers with fixed decimal places | 12.3450, 98.7654 | Varies | Exact | decimal (in some languages) | Depends on the implementation |
| Complex      | Numbers with real and imaginary parts | 3 + 2i, -1.5 - 0.8i | 64 (each part), 128 (each part) | Approximate | complex | Varies based on the precision |
| Boolean      | Logical values (true or false) | True, False | 1 | N/A | bool | True or False |
| Character    | Single characters, often treated as numeric values (ASCII codes) | 'A', 'z', '5' | 8 (for ASCII) | N/A | char | Typically 0 to 255 for ASCII |

**Additional Details:**

- **Range:** Integer types have a range of values they can represent based on the number of bits allocated for them. For signed integers, the range is typically from -(2^(n-1)) to 2^(n-1) - 1, where 'n' is the number of bits.
- **Precision and Size:** Floating-point types offer different levels of precision based on their bit size (e.g., single precision, double precision). Larger bit sizes generally provide higher precision but consume more memory.
- **Fixed-Point Precision:** The precision of fixed-point numbers is determined by the allocation of bits for the integer and fractional parts, offering exact decimal representation with controlled precision.
- **Complex Numbers:** Each part of a complex number (real and imaginary) has its own precision and size.
- **Language-Specific Implementations:** Different programming languages might have additional or specific numeric types, varying in size, precision, and nomenclature.

**Key Points:**

* Number types are like compartments for storing different kinds of numbers in programming.
* Choose the right type based on whether you need whole numbers, decimals, or other special values.
* Be mindful of precision and memory usage when working with numbers.
* **Precision:** Floating-point numbers are like adjustable tools—they might not always be exact, so be careful when using them for precise calculations.
* **Memory Usage:** Choosing the right number type is like picking the right-sized compartment—it saves space and keeps things organized.
* **Language Specifics:** Different programming languages might have slightly different names or rules for their number types, just like different toolboxes might have different setups.
